This is a simple MLton FFI binding to the NanoMQ library (https://github.com/rigtorp/nanomq).

The file 'build.sm' is a build file for Smbt (https://github.com/finrod/smbt).  Smbt is by far the easiest way to build this, but you can look inside the build file to get a sense of how you might build it manually instead, too.

The 'sendtest' and 'recvtest' programs attempt to communicate through a context at /tmp/nmq3 --- exceptions will be thrown if this file already exists.

Because this depends on NanoMQ (which is GPL licensed), the bindings are also GPL.  Sorry 'bout that.

The Makefile in the root will attempt to fetch a copy of NanoMQ from GitHub.  The library is dependent on having a copy of the NanoMQ sources in a directory called 'nanomq'.  Git submodules might do the right thing too if you know how those work.
